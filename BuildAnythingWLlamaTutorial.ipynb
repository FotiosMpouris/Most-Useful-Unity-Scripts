            "Text: Have you seen a FinTech founder pitch his company? Since 2011, we have been witnessing many of them across the world. There was one common thing irrespective of whether you saw the pitch in the US or Europe, or Asia: everyone talked about disrupting banks and displacing incumbents. In 2013, this space was still in its infancy. Nobody cared about the mushrooming FinTech startups or their founders. So these founders had to try harder; they did what they had to do: pitch hard and talk about total disruption. The FinTech founders challenged the traditional offerings by the banks &amp; FIs and believed that over-the-top (unlicensed) products would win. This kind of thinking stemmed from the fact that this was happening in other industries like transportation (Uber/Ola/Grab), communication (WhatsApp &amp; Skype), and Â (Airbnb) â a power shift from asset-based value propositions to aggregation and asset-light OTT platforms. The FinTechs were looking to disrupt the traditional financial services industry similarly, but as some of them grew larger in size, they were met with a bitter truth. Â  As Uber &amp; Lyft disrupted transportation and Amazon &amp; Alibaba disrupted commerce, FinTechs tried doing the same to the financial services industry, but one major disadvantage: the traditional players had something special, and that it turned out that it is indeed a strong moat â the banking license. Most readers understand the advantage that banks have with a lot of experience in handling regulatory and compliance matters but let me explain a seemingly lesser-known thing. Lending is one of the core functions of a bank â one that really helps to make money. However, to lend, you need cheap capital. Banks with their licenses are deposit-taking institutions and, therefore, have access to cheap capital. Lending FinTechs without the license cant be deposit-taking institutions, and so their cost of capital is much higher. Now, this is just one example; there are many more advantages of FinTechs having a banking license. And that is why any FinTech that has grown to a certain size pursues a license. â With a banking license, large FinTech players could have cheaper access to capital, make money from a float, be on the right side of regulation, competitive advantage over the other FinTechs, and confidence-building in the eyes of investors &amp; customers, as well as new revenues from new offerings such as BaaS offering for other FinTechs. In some countries, access to key digital infrastructure (eKYC, credit bureaus, real-time payments) is being restricted to only banks but let's not go there as that is stated to go away (or there are workarounds). A banking license also helps FinTechs expand and provide its customers with the complete bouquet of banking services (one-stop-shop and not just point solutions) and helps them to create a better brand for themselves. With the above advantages, a banking license could be seen as the right move for any large FinTech. Here are a few of the startups that have gone this route: â Â      â Another point to note is that the established FinTech players begin to realize that at some stage, in order to continue playing a bigger and bigger role in the financial services industry, they will be required to capture a larger part of the value chain; they will need to take away a market share. For example, Wirecard was founded in 1999 and focused on payments services. After establishing itself in payment services, Wirecard decided to offer banking services to its clients after 7 years of its inception. Like Wirecard, established FinTech players like Zopa, Tyro, and Klarna also realized the importance of rebundling their service offerings into a bank. Zopa started its banking operations after 13 years of its founding; Tyro and Klarna each took 12 years to figure out that unbundling has some inherent limitations. FinTech players realize that getting a bank license can be a key to continue raising money and fueling their ambitions. Becoming a bank opens up the possibilities to invest in the latest technology with the aim to develop new products and reach customers quickly. â This trend of shifting the focus from the unbundling of banking services to rebundling provided some signals when big names such as Monzo, Klarna, Sofi, Paytm, WeBank, and Tyro Payments started obtaining banking licenses. Well-established players such as MoneyLion in PFM, Acorn in micro-investing, and FairFX in payments have also begun their banking services in 2018â19. In 2019, Zhong An, WeLab, and Ping An are the big FinTech names that obtained banking licenses. These companies are soon going to start their banking operations, while Square, Coinbase, LendingClub, and Circle have applied for the necessary banking licenses. â This trend of affecting the entire circle of money for customers can also be witnessed through the incorporation of many neobanks which have been founded in the last three to four years across the world. The favorable regulatory policies, along with FinTechsâ desire to capture a larger market share, have only fueled the race to become a bank. We expect this trend to continue with some big names revisiting their strategy and focusing on the larger value chain of banking services. â  To learn about Proveâs identity solutions and how to accelerate revenue while mitigating fraud,   schedule a demo   today.\n",

            "Text: Blog       Regulations have always been a cumbersome affair for the banking and financial services industry. The global financial crisis exposed many loopholes in the existing regulatory risk assessment framework. However, since then, regulators have sprung into action and are constantly looking for ways to enhance their supervision of the industry, ensuring that a repeat of the 2008 crisis does not happen. As a result, several enhancements to the existing regulations (Basel II, MiFID II, Solvency II, PSD II) and newer regulations (GDPR, Dodd-Frank) have come into play. With these regulations, financial watchdogs have begun to fix the challenges in the financial regulatory framework, but this has, in turn, resulted in a significant cost burden on banks and FIs. They spent close to $100 billion on compliance in 2016. â Â      â There are hundreds and thousands of rule changes with every regulatory activity, which financial institutions need to be constantly aware of â any small mishap can cost them billions of dollars. However, the task is not as easy as it may sound â regulatory documents are thousands of pages long. It is challenging for banks and FIs, especially for the smaller ones who donât have as many resources, to go through every one of them in a short period, identify the relevant change needs, and apply those changes in their processes to stay compliant. â Moreover, there have been strong mandates on how data needs to be managed. This is a compelling case for technology-driven innovation, where ML and NLP can help banks scan these documents and extract relevant information that caters to their business, thus enabling them to take the necessary steps to stay compliant. This is where RegTech comes in. â RegTech, defined as the use of new technologies to solve regulatory and compliance requirements more effectively and efficiently, has established a solid foundation within the FinTech ecosystem by coming up with solutions that targeted complex new regulations, litigation, and regulatory remediation areas faced by banks, and the overall reduction of costs of compliance. With the use of agile, cloud-based technologies, RegTech provides FIs help with their compliance needs. With the technology spend by banks and FIs expected to reach $80 billion by 2020, there is a massive opportunity for RegTech to scale and make a difference. â There has been a surge in the number of RegTech startups that provide a range of services, such as regulatory reporting solutions, data governance tools, transaction fraud monitoring, e-KYC, risk management, etc. Some large technology providers also offer comprehensive GRC solutions. Thus, banks and FIs have a plethora of choices available for transforming their governance, risk, and compliance functions. Moreover, the scope of RegTech spans over regulators as well.

            "Text: While often seen as dinosaurs of the financial services industry, banks have to bear the brunt of regulatory compliance which FinTech companies are often spared of. As we have seen, there are reasons why it is so hard to regulate FinTech. But due to the size, the financial and HR capabilities of banks and the responsibilities they have to their customers, they are required to cope with hostile regulatory environments in all countries. â There are at least seven national and 50 state regulators passing the legal compliance burden on the banking industry. Among those are the Federal Reserve, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. â The regulatory institutions pass at least six of the most important constraints listed by the WEF that banks have to face, which can have an inhibiting effect on the attempts to deploy risky but innovative solutions. Among those constraints are bank capital requirements, collateral requirements, liquidity rules, rules governing derivatives, transparency requirements, and a delineation of the businesses that institutions are allowed to engage in: â  Bank capital requirements and the risks allowed to be taken require banks to hold more and higher-quality capital. In addition, through capital risk weightings, banks are incentivized to hold lower-risk assets that are less likely to plummet in value during a crisis. The aim of the requirement is to limit liquidity or solvency issues for financial institutions. The most important implication of the requirement is to discourage banks from investing in alternatives or the related debt by reducing the profitability of engaging in such transactions. â  Collateral requirements have been recently tightened for banks. The regulatory bodies are attempting to incentivize banks to hold instruments that have historically been low in risk as well as liquid across market cycles. Collateral requirements are the ones that have a strong effect on the innovation opportunities for banks as they serve as a constraint for banks to get involved in the many types of alternative investments (which are not liquid or considered low-risk). â  Liquidity rules oblige banks in the US and Europe to maintain a 30-day supply of cash and liquid securities. In addition, banks must comply with the IFRS guidelines that define whether assets can be counted towards the liquidity requirements. Liquidity rules also contribute to the constraints to engage in innovative and risky moves as no alternative asset meets the liquidity standards. Hence, banks tend to turn away from them. â  Derivatives requirements are another set of rules for banks to comply with. They stand for the requirement for derivatives to be marked to market each day and firms are required to post collateral that meets requirements similar to those imposed on banks. â In the attempts to increase the transparency of the financial system, regulatory bodies are passing extra reporting requirements. Regulators require more information about the activities of financial institutions, helping them to assess the stability of individual firms and the system as a whole. Banks and other financial institutions are forced to pour additional funds into increasing the transparency of their activities and enhancing the reporting function. â The investment activities through venture arms and incumbents are also under the strict eyes of regulators. Major banks now support venture arms and even have their accelerators to nurture innovative startups. However, the task is not an easy one for banks as these activities are scaling and, hence, have an impact on operations. These activities are being phased out by banks in the US, following the Dodd-Frank Act and the Volcker Rule. As for Europe, those activities are strongly discouraged in Europe by the new Basel III capital requirements. â  To learn more about Proveâs identity solutions and how to accelerate revenue while mitigating fraud,   schedule a demo   today.\n",

            "Text: Weâve generally seen that when people talk about FinTech and its impact, they talk about funding received by leading startups, unicorns, and the valuation of the startups. Some enlightened folk also talk about the user base, user growth, and other popular metrics. Some even conducted surveys with 1000â1500 people (only) in each country to gauge the adoption of FinTech. We think a lot about the impact of FinTech (occupational hazards :)) and how it should be measured, and we have been trying to answer that question since 2013. All of the above methods are not wrong, but we felt something was missing. So we went with the traditional approach of looking at the market share being captured by FinTechs. We are focusing our efforts (beginning this month) to gauge the impact through the percentage of market share by country and by segment. We think the best way of numerically measuring impact is by measuring the dent made by FinTech in the market. By âdent,â we mean market share, and to do this, we collected data on the top FinTechs across geographies and analyzed their impact on the market. We will be doing a lot more in subsequent articles and reports â it's not easy and time-consuming. â     â â A few companies are beginning to come out of their shell and impact the market in terms of market share. Here are three companies with less than 1% market share currently:Â  â     â â We had a hard time finding companies that have scaled effectively to capture a part of the market in a significant way. Such examples are far and few across segments in the FinTech world. The reason is simple: FinTechs are yet to scale broadly. If the segment has a small market size, FinTechs still struggle, and if the segment has a huge market, FinTechs seem only to have a small share of it. After much searching, we have identified some FinTech startups which have captured &gt;1% of the market share. Some FinTechs even hold 16% and 90% of a segment, but these are very few â this is just the beginning of the impact that FinTech will create. Also, we may be able to identify many more as we dig deep. (If you know players with &gt;5% in market share in a particular segment in a country, do write to us). â We also found some other players with a significant impact, but it is difficult to quantify the market share captured at this stage. (We may update this section soon.) We used proxy data (such as phone owner percentage, number of transactions in the segment, number of accounts of the financially included population, and credit cards) to demonstrate how well they are doing:Â  â  About 28.8% of Kenyan phone owners have borrowed at least once from M-Shwari. About 7% of financially included people in Brazil are customers of Nubank. In addition, the bank has issued over 5 million credit cards in Brazil. About 1.4% of the financially included population of the USA have an account in Robinhood. About 7% of e-money payments in Japan happen through LINE Pay.  â In the years to come, FinTech will go mainstream and leverage technology to make a dent in the market by launching innovative products faster, cheaper, and more convenient than the existing products. A classic example would be the rise of neobanks in Europe. These neobanks are preferred by millennials and Generation Z for smooth &amp; frictionless experience, low costs, and the mobile experience over their traditional counterparts. According to a study by A.T. Kearney, the customer base of neobanks has grown by 15 million while the retail banks have seen a decrease of 2 million customers. The study also estimates that by 2023, Europeâs neobanks could have up to 85 million customersâabout 20 percent of the population over the age of 14. â     â â For each of these FinTechs mentioned in this article, there are 1000 more that are still minuscule, and even though they may be growing fast, they haven't been able to shift the market even a little. As we have done before (since 2013), we will continue watching this space and bringing you more such analyses. â With the continued focus on innovation, technology, and user experience, which enables FinTech startups to grab a bigger pie of the market share, the future of FinTech looks bright. We have highlighted a few of the examples above that have already started taking away the market share previously held by traditional incumbents. In the future, we believe that if a leading FinTech startup has a double-digit market share in the country in a particular financial segment, then FinTech has truly arrived. In the next 5 to 10 years, we will witness more examples, and consequently, see more companies that will showcase the true power of FinTech. â  To learn about Proveâs identity solutions and how to accelerate revenue while mitigating fraud,   schedule a demo   today.\n",

            "Text: Ugur Karakoc | E+ | Getty Images   From China's Ant Group to Sweden's Klarna, here is the complete list of the world's top 200 fintech companies. CNBC partnered with independent research firm Statista to establish a transparent overview of the top fintech companies. Statista analyzed over 1,500 firms across nine different market segments, evaluating each one against a set of key performance indicators, including revenue, user numbers, and total funding raised. The final list includes some of the biggest companies in the sector — Ant Group, Tencent, PayPal, Stripe, Klarna and Revolut — as well as several up-and-coming startups seeking to mold the future of financial services. The categories include:  Neobanking Digital payments Digital assets Digital financial planning Digital wealth management Alternate financing Alternate lending Digital banking solutions Digital business solutions  You can search by country, category, or company name to see which firms made the cut.   For a deep dive on the categories and the standout trends within each one, click here. Methodology To identify the top 200 fintech companies, Statista carried out a quantitative analysis of the global market across nine categories. These categories reflect the fact that fintechs in different fields can't be compared like-for-like. A business like Monzo, for example, operates in a very different manner to Stripe (Stripe isn't a licensed bank and can't originate its own loans). To help with the research, CNBC issued a public call for nominations in March, giving eligible fintechs the chance to share more information on their business model, revenue, transaction volumes, and other key data. Since many fintech businesses are privately held, they aren't required to disclose their accounts publicly. Voluntary sharing of information about business models was key to analyzing the market. Statistics More than 1,500 fintech companies were assessed by Statista during the analysis period, and over 10,000 data points were assessed, including annual reports, company websites, and news articles. Statista developed a scoring model for the companies by calculating the aggregated scores on how firms performed versus their respective KPIs — revenues and revenue per employee, for example — along with a separate score on how the companies performed against specific KPIs within their respective market segments. Between five and 40 companies were selected for each individual market segment. To decide which ones should make the cut, Statista broke down the scoring model into a 40% weighting for general KPIs, and 60% for segment-specific KPIs. The companies with the highest score within their market segment made the list. The number of companies awarded per market segment varied depending on the size of the respective market segment.\n",

            "Text: This is a guide for pre-IPO tech CEOs for when and how to acquire companies. Many thanks to Bob Borek, Dave Eisenberg, Tyler Finkelstein, Auren Hoffman, Shahir Kassam-Adams, Pete McCabe, Tal Rosenberg, Bobby Samuels, and Jim Williamson for their suggestions and edits putting this together.  Early in my startup journey, M&amp;A was not a part of the toolkit I ever considered. I suspect this is true for most startup founders: buying a company seems prohibitively expensive and complex, and there is very little playbook for how to do a deal. Only after LiveRamp became a public company did I really begin to understand the toolkit: we had the balance sheet and the ambitions where we made several successful deals. When I went back into the early-stage world, I brought this toolkit with me — and have now led 15 transactions (3 on the sell-side, and 12 on the buy-side) ranging from 6-figure to 10-figure deals. I credit the toolkit with accelerating Datavant’s path by several years, and helping us very quickly establish product-market fit and build scale. I’ve tried to summarize the lessons that I’ve learned on the buy-side below, and will walk through:  Why most M&amp;A fails The four types of deals Five prerequisites to considering M&amp;A as a strategy The playbook: Executing the deal process The playbook: Defaulting to no and debating the deal internally The playbook: Structuring the deal The playbook: Pre-planning the integration   Why Most M&amp;A Fails  While I believe that well-executed M&amp;A can be a very valuable part of a toolkit, it’s important to recognize that most acquisitions made by most companies are poor decisions. M&amp;A hypotheses are usually presented as a “1+1=5” scenario; you put together two companies, have some “synergies,” and suddenly the combined business is worth more than either business standalone. In the vast majority of cases, this is overoptimistic. It’s helpful to think about this equation:  Value of Combined Business = Value of Acquirer + Value of Acquiree + Synergies — Dis-synergies  There are two very common mistakes that buyers make:   Over-optimism on synergies. It’s easy to imagine how everything can go right in a deal, without thinking through how hard it is to execute. The best way to solve this is usually to i) have a base case and a stretch case plan (and make sure the deal makes sense in the base case, and is a home run in the stretch case) and ii) make sure that executives on your team sign up for the numbers. It’s shocking how frequently deals happen with revenue targets that the head of sales doesn’t sign off on, for example.  Not acknowledging the dis-synergies. Every deal has dis-synergies; these are usually: distracting the teams (both the deal process &amp; the integration are major distractions for both companies), culture mismatch or culture dilution, reducing the acquiree’s incentives and/or sense of mission, and increased organizational &amp; technical complexity. Under the right circumstances and well managed, these dis-synergies might create an “Integration Tax” of 10–20% — slowing down the business by that amount. But it can also be 100% if not well managed.  As a result, instead of “1+1=5”, many deals end up “1+1 = 1.5” (or even “1+1=0.8”). So it is critical to: i) understand the dis-synergies ahead of time, ii) create a plan to minimize them (and obsess over this post-transaction), and iii) make sure that a deal is still valuable even in the scenario of a base case success + some dis-synergies.  The Four Types of Deals  Often, when making the case for an acquisition, a variety of rationales are presented. It’s usually helpful to put the deal into a single bucket — everything from deal structure to integration approach depends on which bucket you put the business in. There are four types of deals that I’ve seen successfully executed:   Buying a team. This is usually a simple deal &amp; integration, where you’re effectively hiring a team. I’ve seen this work successfully with very small businesses (1–5 employees), and also businesses that get you expertise in a new market (for example, we built Datavant’s public sector strategy via an acquisition of a team who understood how to sell to the government). The main considerations in this kind of deal are: i) is the entire team up to your talent bar, ii) making sure everyone on the team wants to join and is bought into the mission/culture/roles, and iii) avoiding internal compensation disparities between an acquired team and your pre-existing team. Once you make the acquisition, you’ll also often think through whether you want them to continue to operate as a group or split across the organization.  Buying a product. This is usually the trickiest type of deal, and often looks good on paper but rarely works. In this scenario, you’re buying a product that you believe you can bring to market more effectively than the acquiree — but you’re not in love with the acquiree’s business model, team, and standalone traction. I’ve seen it work in cases where it’s an adjacency to your core business (for example, expanding into a major new product line) with substantial customer overlap but without much technical overlap. But you will need to consider i) whether you will ultimately need to rebuild the product in your own architecture/stack, and ii) why your team will be able to sell it better than the acquiree standalone. These two points usually make the synergy/dyssynergy balance come out strongly against this type of deal.  Buying a set of customers. This is a move where you believe that your product can quickly gain share by applying it to an acquiree’s base of customers. I’ve seen this play work most successfully in high network effect businesses. To pull this off successfully, you need to think through customer-by-customer what their reaction will be (and obsess over your messaging), how you will manage feature gaps that inevitably exist, and how long you’re willing to run two products in parallel.  Buying a business. The biggest acquisitions are when you are acquiring the whole package — you like the team, the product, and the existing market traction PLUS you believe that you can grow faster together. These are the most expensive deals (there’s a great company on the other side), and usually the highest upside. The key considerations here are around how to actually drive synergies while maintaining the “magic” that makes the acquiree’s business fire on all cylinders. Facebook + Instagram or Google + DoubleClick are probably the canonical examples of this type of deal (and there are thousands of failed examples where the magic was lost).  Clarifying the bucket upfront is extremely valuable — and will give clarity to the entire deal team and the acquiree on what’s important and what to expect. Finally, in my experience, rationales that are not on this list generally don’t work (for example, “because it’s distressed/cheap,” “because otherwise they’ll compete with us,” “because we need to grow faster,” “because if we don’t buy them Company X will,” etc.).  Five Prerequisites to Consider M&amp;A as a Strategy  I don’t believe you need to be over a certain size to consider M&amp;A (or that you must consider M&amp;A over a certain size). Instead, I think there are a few prerequisites to be ready to consider M&amp;A as a company:   Extreme clarity on your vision &amp; strategy. M&amp;A can work very well as an accelerant to a well-defined strategy. It is extremely distracting if your strategy is poorly defined, as you will chase ideas that are non-core and be too slow to disqualify shiny objects.  Clarity that this is a top priority. For your first deal to be successful, you need to make a deal &amp; integration a top-3 priority of the CEO for 2+ quarters. If the opportunity doesn’t rise to that level, it’s not worth pursuing.  Ability to have one of your top performers put everything down and focus on the deal. I’ll talk more about the role of the “Deal Quarterback” below, but you will need a superstar focused exclusively on making the deal &amp; integration going successfully. If you can’t spare that from other priorities, it’s not worth pursuing M&amp;A.  Ability to manage legal counsel well. The speed of the deal will most likely be determined by legal negotiations; you need to hire external counsel and be ready to project manage the deal closely.  An exceptional CFO and/or deep fluency in your numbers. Deals are complexifiers for finance teams; you will need someone great thinking through the details and mechanics.  On the other hand, a large balance sheet isn’t critical (you can structure equity deals and earnout-based deals if there’s truly a 1+1=5 scenario).  The Playbook: Executing the deal process  Once you begin to get conviction in a hypothesis, you’ll want to optimize for speed+quality deal execution. Because M&amp;A is generally a massive distraction for both businesses, speed &amp; decisiveness are critical to not lose business momentum. You will have a team of advisors who believe you should negotiate more, spend more time being thorough on understanding risk, and maintain optionality on aspects of the deal; a big part of your job is to champion velocity over these concerns.

            "Text: What is Customer Acquisition?  Customer acquisition is the process of winning new customers for your business. It involves attracting the attention of your target prospects and convincing them to purchase your product or service. Acquisition activities can include cold calls, email newsletters, webinars, and paid advertising—anything that helps you get new customers. These days, the most successful customer acquisition strategies involve highly personalized, omnichannel marketing based on high-quality customer data.      Why is customer acquisition important?  A business can’t succeed without customers. This is what makes customer acquisition (along with retention) so important for companies: effective acquisition strategies sustainably grow a business’s customer base while increasing brand awareness.   4 key customer acquisition channels  A customer acquisition channel is any place where people can discover your business and, usually, turn prospects into customers.  Below, we list some of the most influential customer acquisition channels to consider in your strategy.   Social media  Social media use has risen steadily since it first came onto the scene in the early 2000s. Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram all have users in the billions, with new apps like TikTok quickly catching up (TikTok launched in 2016, and just two years later boasted half a billion users).  Social media’s popularity makes it a great channel for customer acquisition. For one, it builds brand awareness. Many businesses use social media to engage customers or promote a new product or sale (e.g. sharing a discount code on Twitter, replying to a user’s comment).  One survey found that  71% of consumers  have bought something after seeing it in a social media post. And 36% of B2B decision-makers said they used social media to source new products or services.  With the advent of shoppable Instagram posts, influencer marketing, and so on, social media has become all the more appealing for acquisition. To launch an effective strategy, the first step is to understand where your customers are spending their time (e.g. is your target audience Reddit-obsessed, or have more of an affinity for YouTube?). Then, you can start to employ a strategy of social listening (to gain feedback on your brand, products, etc.) and creating relevant content to effectively grab people’s interest and move them through the funnel.   Email marketing  Email marketing can have a huge return on investment for businesses: like  $42 for every $1 spent  (which means a 4,200% ROI), according to one HubSpot study.  For this reason, email is a popular medium for lead nurturing, and to steadily build customer relationships.  For email marketing to be successful, there are a few ground rules to follow. First, only email users who have opted in, or freely given their email address to your business. This builds trust, and avoids your brand coming across as spammy.  Second, create different email campaigns tailored to each buyer persona. For instance, would a developer be interested in a newsletter that focuses on marketers? Probably not. But perhaps they’d be more interested in a virtual product tour. In short: don’t forget to personalize campaigns. (You can even use  dynamic content for open-time personalization  to improve engagement rates.)   Content marketing  Content marketing is another worthwhile strategy for customer acquisition. First, it offers value to customers, whether it’s through informative blog articles, industry reports, infographics, webinars, video tutorials (and so on). Second, it helps establish your brand as an authority on a certain topic, which can serve as a differentiator between you and your competitors.  Content marketing also works well in tandem with email marketing. By gating pieces of content, customers can share their contact information to freely access a webinar or new guide, which bolsters your email list. Then, you can insert different pieces of content into your newsletters or nurture streams to continuously engage customers.   SEO  SEO, or search engine optimization, refers to optimizing your organic web content to rank higher in search results for specific keywords, which can bring more traffic to your website.  Ranking higher in search engine results has a huge impact on your website’s visibility. One analysis found that roughly 71% or search traffic clicks come from the first page of Google.  As such, SEO can be a cost-effective and highly impactful way to acquire new customers, by having them organically discover your website and start engaging with your business.\n",

            "Text: In today's hyper-saturated markets, the name of the game is differentiation. If you're doing the same thing as everyone else, your chances of success are extremely low. It's true that you can offer a feature that your competitors don't, but that's not enough of a differentiation upon which you can build a company. Instead, when everyone else is focused on getting paid, you focus on bringing tangible value. The money will follow. Here's why that's a good strategy.    Create delight   When you focus your time and resources on value creation--whether that's helping someone with a pitch, assisting them in getting to know their landscape better, or connecting them to a relevant investor--and you do not focus on monetization, you create delight.

Think about anything in your life that brings you delight, like a good cup of coffee. You'd pay for that thing.   Ask this simple four-word question   I have spoken about this before, but I would recommend asking every person you sit with, in a business context, what their challenges are. Four simple words: \"What are your challenges?\" What you might discover is that another person's challenges, something they find to be difficult, for you might be super simple.  By helping others overcome their challenges, you train yourself to become a problem solver. This will help and serve you down the road when you're trying to overcome your own challenges.   Build a bank of favors   OK, I'll admit, this point is a bit cynical. ‏The irony of this point is that if you do help people in order to eventually receive back, that lack of authenticity will be completely transparent, and will become an obstacle to achieving your goal. Having said that, there is nothing wrong with building an army of people who you have helped in one way or another, and who you know you can call upon when you need a favor in return.   Transfer leverage from them to you    This is such an important point. Most vendors approach a company, make promises, and get paid on credit, with the promise of later on delivering. When pitching your services, you do not have the leverage to define the terms. The person you are pitching to has to either accept or reject your pitch and then define the terms of the engagement, with little back-and-forth negotiations. However, if you focus your time on delivering and not negotiating, the recipient of your value will eventually reach the conclusion that they need you--at which point, you have the leverage, not them. When they approach you after you have already delivered, you can see the delight in their eyes, and then you can define the terms of the engagement.   Strengthen your reputation   There is an ancient Jewish saying that a good name is more important than wealth. I could not possibly agree more. Your name, your reputation, your credibility, your integrity--these are things that matter more than anything in business. By focusing on the other person sitting across from you, instead of focusing on yourself, you establish a relationship, which leads to a reputation of being kind, attentive, resourceful, and just plain helpful.  The overall concept here is to create a situation in which you facilitate the success of others. You pave the road for others to go on their way to success, and eventually, you end up joining them on that road. Empower others, elevate others, promote others, and what ends up happening is that your brand gets elevated with theirs, and everyone wins.\n",

            "Text: Annealing:  A  process that changes the properties of a material to make it more workable. It is a best practice to anneal metals before they are joined together. That way the pieces will stay aligned during the soldering process without being affected by applied work stresses developed during fabrication.  \n",
            " Market annealing:  The effort a company expends to make itself and a market pliable enough for early go-to-market. It applies when the company has a better idea than the market for what the market needs, and so has to work hard to overcome the inherent shape of the market. And it can take years of struggling for relatively modest progress.  \n",
            "While category creation is an important topic in the long arc of a company, it just doesn’t provide useful guidance on how a startup can go from product to, say, the low tens of millions of annual recurring revenue (ARR) in an early market. \n",
            "Further, it’s become somewhat of a false narrative that if only you “do category creation,” you can flip a market from being push-based to pull-based. In reality, many markets never become pull-based, and many companies scrape their way to significant size by fighting one battle after another — uphill and with great effort — but still never quite “crossing the chasm.”\n",
            "On the other hand, understanding how to build a company in the face of a new, immature, or non-existent market is a topic startups should obsess about. Finding product-market fit (PMF) is only part of the journey. Most companies don’t find a magical product that just happens to address a key pain point in the market, thus making their go-to-market (GTM) plan a straightforward one. Rather, they engage in a multi-year-long battle of hammering the shit out of the company   and   the market simultaneously, trying to get the two to hold together. It’s a feedback cycle that often starts with product vision, goes to sales and marketing, and then returns back to product. The cycle continues while the company morphs into something molded by the market, and the market softens to the point where it can consume the product.\n",
            "We refer to this joint dance between company and market as company-market annealing — or market annealing, for short — to try and capture the insane amount of effort needed to integrate both the company and the market as a company marches toward its first $30 million in ARR. (Hell, sometimes the company and market don’t anneal until closer to $100 million). Market annealing is different from finding PMF because it focuses on the steps a company needs to do to shape both itself and an early market, rather than assuming there is some existing product-market combo that just needs to be found. And it’s different from category creation in that it considers the tactical steps a startup needs to take to muscle its vision into the market before either are ready, rather than the long arc of creating a named market with a new buyer, budget, or category — which may never happen. \n",
            "Unfortunately, our experience with market annealing is that there are few easy answers. Yet, there are a lot of things startups can do to better position themselves to be successful. There also are many common pitfalls to avoid, often the result of bad advice that is rife in this particular space. \n",
            "—\n",
            "The point of this post is largely to introduce the notion of market annealing and to differentiate it from PMF and category creation. However, to make it concrete we’ll walk through some of the more salient GTM considerations that are particularly relevant to companies that find they need to at least experiment with outbound sales. \n",
            "Company-market annealing and sales\n",
            "Learn the right GTM from the market\n",
            "A key decision point in navigating early markets is figuring out the correct GTM approach. The hard truth is that figuring out the right GTM approach is often as much an exploration as finding product-market fit, because how the market buys is much more likely dictated by the market than the company. It can take many years and false starts to find the right GTM motion, and the single biggest mistake we see companies make is to lock in and scale a GTM motion too early.\n",
            "It’s very tempting to try and impose a certain GTM motion on a market. Many founders, for example, default to bottom-up because they think it’s less expensive, or that it plays to the early team’s product strengths. Indeed, bottom-up companies are generally much more efficient and predictable to build when they work. But bottom-up only works with certain products in certain markets. And for very early markets, it tends to be much more difficult (although not impossible) to show value without having a conversation with the customer. Over the years we’ve seen many companies try to do bottom-up, fail, and then resort to sales. \n",
            "So take your time. It’s hard. It often takes years of grinding with very little to show. It’s important to remember that the most expensive sales model is one that doesn’t work.\n",
            "Start with founder sales\n",
            "In early markets, if the right GTM motion is unknown, or it’s clear that the right approach is top-down, then it’s best for companies to double down on founder sales. If a founder can’t sell it, nobody can. Founder sales can get a company a lot further than many boards realize, certainly to the first $4 million or so in ARR. Along the way, it’s good to hire a few senior sales reps to help navigate the procurement process and explore the market — but they do not replace the founders’ involvement in the process of doing evangelical selling. \n",
            "These reps (which we call renaissance reps) should have experience in early markets, and have the background to experiment with various approaches to selling. It’s best to hire two or three for the initial team, and if they have different backgrounds it will help broaden the exploration. Additionally, having several reps participate in early selling will help to mitigate successful or unsuccessful outliers. \n",
            "Renaissance reps should help provide market feedback on the buyer, use cases, pricing, GTM approaches, and other considerations. Further, a good renaissance rep should also help determine if a more bottom-up strategy really is appropriate. It’s not uncommon for a company to make two or three sales hires before finding their first renaissance rep. \n",
            "Despite their experience, do not just assume that the new sales team can operate without any guidance. Instead, hold weekly sales meetings that founders, sales reps, and marketing attend, discussing what everyone is seeing and hearing in their interactions with external prospects and stakeholders. Annealing is a full company effort. The more shared context, the better.\n",
            "What AEs do in early markets\n",
            "For companies with technical products, it’s very rare that an account rep — even a renaissance rep — can effectively convince a customer that a product is right for them (we call this bringing the customer to “technical close”). In the very early days, that’s the job of the founders. What AEs, or account executives, are good at is qualifying whether an opportunity is real, navigating a buyer, finding budget, figuring out how to position the commercials, and navigating the procurement process. All things that are aided by deep experience, and difficult to learn on the job. \n",
            "On the other hand, sales engineers (SEs) often can help get a buyer to technical close. So SEs are a very good way to scale out founder sales without dropping the ball on technical close. Early on, many companies choose to recruit an engineer to help with SE work and, only later, to hire an SE. This brings engineering closer to the customer, developing sympathy that is very useful to guiding internal product and engineering decisions. \n",
            "Annealing quotas\n",
            "When the first sales reps show up, one of the questions they will ask is, “What’s my quota?” It’s an interesting problem given that, in a new company, there have never been sales quotas before. With company-market annealing, even quotas are annealed! That is, there will be a continual time-pressure feedback loop to get to industry-standard productivity rates (quotas set at 4-5x the loaded cost of a rep (base+commission)). \n",
            "Here are some ideas for managing this:\n",
            " Try to establish/rationalize a first-year quota at 1x the loaded cost of the rep. If you were doing founder-led sales before bringing on the first sales rep, there will be some understanding regarding what can be sold, at what price, and over what timeframe. Founders need to recognize that, early on, they are likely to be far more successful selling than the first reps, so factor this into the analysis. \n",
            "There will be a ramp time to productivity, so pay base+commission for at least two quarters. This will allow the sales rep to get comfortable with the environment and become productive in your market segment.\n",
            " Pay for results; manage activities. In early markets, it’s tempting to want to fuel momentum by paying commision for leads, forecast accuracy, first meetings, POCs, new logos, or number of emails sent to customers, etc. In our experience this rarely works. Instead, keep the incentive pay focused on getting deals done and real dollars committed, and manage the other activities as part of the weekly sales meeting. \n",
            " Anneal, anneal, anneal. There’s a high probability that the initial quotas will be incorrect, despite the best intentions. Adjust accordingly after six months, rather t\n",
